Identification of Researchers: This research is being done by S M Taiabul Haque, Tanusreee Sharma, Md Mirajul Islam, Anupam Das, and Ishtiaque Ahmed. We are with the University of Central Missouri, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, North Carolina State University, and the University of Toronto.

Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to find out user perceptions of COVID-19 (popularly known as coronavirus) tracking smartphone apps.

Request for Participation: We are inviting you to participate in a study on coronavirus tracking smartphone apps. It is up to you whether you would like to participate. If you decide not to participate, you will not be penalized in any way. You can also decide to stop at any time without penalty. If you do not wish to answer any of the questions, you may simply skip them. Once you submit an anonymous survey, we will not know which survey is yours.

Exclusions: You must be at least 18 years of age and use a smartphone at least once a day to participate in this study.

Description of Research Method: This study involves completing an anonymous survey about user perceptions of coronavirus tracking smartphone apps. The survey will ask you about your opinions about these apps. The survey will take about ten minutes to finish.

Privacy: All of the information we collect will be anonymous. We will not record your name or any information that could be used to identify you. Your confidentiality will be maintained to the degree permitted by the technology used. Specifically, no guarantees can be made regarding the interception of the data sent via the Internet by any third parties.

Explanation of Risks: The risks associated with participating in this study are similar to the risks of everyday life.

Explanation of Benefits: You will benefit from participating in this study by knowing more about coronavirus tracking smartphone apps.

Another concern would be if the app is legit. I would question if it truly works. Eg: What if I do come in contact with someone with the virus but the app doesn't detect it. 3. Certain questions that come to mind before downloading an app, which may or may be relevant: Why should I choose this app over another app? Are there even similar apps out there? So far during the pandemic I have been fine without this app, do I really need it? Does it require the person whom I have been in contact with to have the app as well? 4.
