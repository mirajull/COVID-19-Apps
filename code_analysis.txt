The App logs information. Sensitive information should never be logged. & 36\\ \hline
App can read/write to External Storage. Any App can read data written to External Storage. & 16\\ \hline
This App uses Java Hash Code. It's a weak hash function and should never be used in Secure Crypto Implementation. & 35\\ \hline
App uses SQLite Database and execute raw SQL query. Sensitive information should be encrypted and written to the database. & 25\\ \hline
Files may contain hardcoded sensitive informations like usernames, passwords, keys etc. & 25\\ \hline
Insecure WebView Implementation. Execution of user controlled code in WebView is a critical Security Hole. & 5\\ \hline
IP Address disclosure & 12\\ \hline
MD5 is a weak hash known to have hash collisions. & 15\\ \hline
SHA-1 is a weak hash known to have hash collisions. & 9\\ \hline
The App uses an insecure Random Number Generator. & 23\\ \hline
